# Lil Yachty – drive ME crazy!

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Imagine life
Imagine life without me,
it's a waste of time
You want the kind of love
that can make a child.
Don't want just anybody!
Good love fills my body up
like a glass
when you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind
Someone like me is hard to find
No mistaken
If I am there
Well aware
You are always mine
And still you seem so surprised
Always gon' be mine
I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away,
you drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it!
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away,
you drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it!
Imagine me
Circling through life
without a piece of you!
7 out of 7 days I'm needing you
You bring life to the party!
Good love feels like butterflies
suffocating your insides, oh
If it's a late night
you know I'll try
I can't unpicture when you ride
I've mistaken thinking
you were taken,
knowing that you are always mine
And still I feel so surprised
You always gon' be mine
Rarely ever missing
Talk is cheap
and time is ticking
Rarely ever tricking
Catch me slippin'
that pussy was leaking!
All my missions pay in millions
I'm Ted DeBiase (God!)
Out late night I'm sinning
Still a Christian
don't tell my Deacon
I mean pastor,
oil her down not talking caster
Riding 'round 6-7 bitches
with no tint you can see
I'm pimpin'
Big 4'5 on my hip
Look like I'm limping,
never simping
One of my cousins crippin',
always grippin'
Shit get dangerous
Always keep it player
We can swap out hoes,
I'm never trippin'
Only love my mother, my sister,
my daughter
All these hoes get slaughtered,
they can't be mine,
pray to the holy father!
